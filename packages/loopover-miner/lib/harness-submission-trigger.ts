// Harness submission-gate wiring orchestrator (#2337): the real-IO half of connecting the gated-submission
// decision (`shouldSubmit`, wrapped by `evaluateHarnessSubmissionTrigger`, @loopover/engine) to a
// real driving loop's own handoff signal. Reads the session's recent decision history to compute the
// consecutive-block circuit-breaker tally, consults the pure decision, and always records exactly one audit
// event -- regardless of outcome, so a paused-pending-human-review session leaves a full trail of why.
//
// NOT WIRED INTO ANY AUTOMATIC SCHEDULE: per this issue's own "manual owner sign-off on the wiring before this
// ships to any default-on profile" deliverable. `prepareOpenPrSubmission` below is the gate→payload bridge:
// on `allow: true` it shapes the exact input `buildOpenPrSpec` (`@loopover/engine`,
// `packages/loopover-engine/src/miner/local-write-tools.ts`, re-exported from the engine public barrel) expects
// as `openPrInput`. It deliberately does NOT call `buildOpenPrSpec` itself -- that stays the caller's job so
// this module stays a decision-to-payload bridge. The in-package caller is `attempt-runner.js`, which imports
// `buildOpenPrSpec` from `@loopover/engine` and runs it after a `ready: true` result (the pre-#5131/#5132
// "unreachable from root `src/mcp/`" boundary no longer applies, but the layering still does: gate evaluate →
// shape openPrInput here → build the runnable local-write spec in the driver). Equivalent MCP call sites
// (e.g. `loopover_open_pr`) can likewise take `openPrInput` from a `ready: true` result.
//
// SESSION-SCOPED, NOT PER-REPO: the circuit breaker's own "pauses the run entirely" wording means the tally is
// counted across EVERY repo's decisions this session, not scoped to one repo -- distinct from #2338's loop-
// reentry circuit breaker, which is deliberately per-repo (a rejection streak on one repo must not pause
// unrelated repos).
