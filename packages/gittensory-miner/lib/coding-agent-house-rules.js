// House-rules-enforced coding-agent construction (#2343 follow-up). buildHouseRulesPreToolUseHook
// (pretooluse-hook.js) is the LIVE PreToolUse interception point, but the engine package's
// createCodingAgentDriver / runCodingAgentAttempt (driver-factory.ts) cannot import it directly -- the
// dependency only ever flows gittensory-miner -> @jsonbored/gittensory-engine, never the reverse (the engine
// package is portable and cannot depend on the miner CLI package). This module is the missing miner-side
// glue: it wraps runCodingAgentAttempt so the `agent-sdk` provider gets house-rule enforcement by DEFAULT --
// a future real call site does not need to remember to attach it itself, closing the exact gap
// buildHouseRulesPreToolUseHook's own doc comment already anticipated ("the live interception wiring itself").
//
// This does not build a CLI entrypoint -- nothing in this package constructs a coding-agent driver in
// production yet (verified: no caller of createCodingAgentDriver/runCodingAgentAttempt exists anywhere in
// packages/gittensory-miner today). That is separate, larger follow-up work. What this DOES guarantee: once
// such a call site exists, it only has to call `runHouseRulesEnforcedCodingAgentAttempt` (a drop-in
// replacement for the engine's own `runCodingAgentAttempt`) to get real, unbypassable house-rule enforcement
// automatically, rather than depending on that future author to remember to wire hooks by hand.

 * own hook double, or a caller composing additional hooks of its own) -- this only fills the gap when the
 * caller omitted it entirely. Providers other than `agent-sdk` (`noop`, `claude-cli`, `codex-cli`) ignore
