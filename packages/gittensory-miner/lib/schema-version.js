// Lightweight schema-versioning convention shared across the miner's local SQLite stores (#4832).
//
// Every store bootstraps its tables with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...` but, until now, carried no
// `user_version`/migration mechanism at all — so an older on-disk file was silently reused with a stale shape.
// This module adds the missing convention without the weight of the main product's `migrations/` runner: each
// store's bootstrap schema is treated as version 1 (BASELINE_SCHEMA_VERSION), and a store's `migrations` array
// describes ONLY the changes AFTER that baseline (`migrations[i]` upgrades the schema from version i+1 to i+2).
// `applySchemaMigrations` reads the file's current `PRAGMA user_version`, runs exactly the pending migrations in
// order, and stamps the new version — so opening an older-schema file runs its outstanding migrations instead of
// silently continuing on an incompatible shape. A pre-versioning file (user_version 0) already carries the
// baseline tables (the idempotent `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` ran), so it is treated as the baseline before any
// post-baseline migration is applied. Pure control flow over an injected `DatabaseSync` handle: no IO of its own
// beyond the PRAGMA read/write and the caller-supplied migration functions, and deterministic given the same
// handle + migration list.

/** The bootstrap schema every store creates inline is, by convention, schema version 1. */

/**
 * Bring a store's on-disk schema up to date, then stamp its `user_version`. `migrations[i]` upgrades from
 * version i+1 to i+2, so the target version is `BASELINE_SCHEMA_VERSION + migrations.length`. Every migration
 * whose resulting version is above the file's current version runs, in order; a file already at (or past) the
 * target runs none. Returns the resulting version. Never runs a migration twice (the stamped `user_version`
 * gates re-runs on the next open) and never DOWNGRADES: a file written by newer code with more migrations is
 * left at its higher version rather than stamped back down. Each migration and its version stamp are applied in
 * one transaction, so a failure part-way through the sequence leaves the file at the last fully-applied version
 * and re-opening resumes at the failed migration (a throwing migration rethrows after its changes roll back).
 *
 * @param {import("node:sqlite").DatabaseSync} db - an open store handle whose baseline tables already exist.
 * @param {Array<(db: import("node:sqlite").DatabaseSync) => void>} [migrations] - post-baseline migrations.
 * @returns {number} the schema version after applying any pending migrations.
