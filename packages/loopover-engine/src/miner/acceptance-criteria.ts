// Acceptance-criteria composer (#4271). Before a coding-agent driver (#4262's interface; #4266/#4267's
// implementations) starts editing, the miner pins down — immutably, so the agent cannot quietly redefine its own
// success bar mid-attempt — what "done" means for this attempt. This module is the pure composition step: it folds
// the two already-shipped Phase 2 primitives — the sanitized `PromptPacket` (prompt-packet.ts, the analyze→coding-
// agent "boundary membrane") and the `FeasibilityGateResult` go/raise/avoid verdict (feasibility.ts) — into one
// document. Producing the document is this module's job; actually writing it into the attempt's worktree is the
// worktree primitive's (#4269), and handing it to the driver is the driver interface's (#4262) — neither is here,
// so this stays pure and side-effect-free like the rest of loopover-engine.
//
// DECISIONS this file makes (per the issue's open questions):
// - Serialization format: JSON, not markdown. The acceptance criteria are an immutable, checksum-verifiable success
//   bar consumed by tooling (a self-review step must be able to prove the target did not move across iterations), so
//   a deterministic, canonically-ordered JSON document beats prose. `serializeAcceptanceCriteria` emits stable-key-
//   order JSON with a trailing newline so a checksum recorded alongside stays byte-stable.
// - Filename: a single fixed name, `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_FILENAME`.
// - Immutability: the built document is deep-frozen (`Object.freeze`, arrays copied+frozen) so it cannot be mutated
//   in-memory for the lifetime of the attempt; the byte-stable serialization is what a caller checksums on disk.
// - Written only on `go`: a `raise`/`avoid` verdict means the attempt should not start, so no criteria file is
//   written. The builder still returns a document (with `writable: false`) so a caller can log *why* it was skipped;
//   `shouldWriteAcceptanceCriteria` is the gate for the write itself.
//
// Redaction is delegated to `sanitizePromptPacketField` rather than re-implemented: this document is exactly as
// exposed to a prompt-injectable coding-agent session as the prompt packet, so it gets the same scrub (idempotent
// on already-sanitized packet text).
