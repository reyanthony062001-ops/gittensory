/**
 * Duplicate-winner adjudication (#dup-winner). Flag-gated by LOOPOVER_DUPLICATE_WINNER.
 *
 * When several OPEN PRs link the same issue (a duplicate cluster), the legacy behavior gate-blocks +
 * auto-closes EVERY sibling as a duplicate — no winner survives. With the flag ON, exactly ONE winner is
 * spared: the earliest claimant. Sparse legacy rows that do not yet have claim timing fail closed so unknown
 * ordering cannot arbitrarily suppress duplicate evidence. Only the LOSERS are blocked/closed; the winner
 * still must pass CI / conflict / gate / linked-issue / slop on its OWN merits.
 *
 * This module is PURE — no IO, no Date, no random — so the same inputs always yield the same verdict and the
 * caller can compute the winner ONCE per review run and thread the result boolean consistently into every
 * surface (advisory finding, close reason, slop, panels), so they agree by construction.
 *
 * ELECTION ORDER: compare `linkedIssueClaimedAt`, the time loopover first observed the PR claiming
 * the issue. GitHub `pull_request.created_at` is intentionally not an ordering signal here: contributors can
 * edit an old placeholder PR to add a linked issue later, so creation time would let backdated claims steal
 * duplicate-winner credit from the PR that actually claimed the issue first. Sparse legacy rows that lack
 * claim timing keep failing closed so unknown ordering cannot suppress duplicate evidence.
 *
 * INVARIANT (the caller MUST honor it): {@link openSiblingNumbers} carries OPEN-only sibling PR numbers. The
 * existing sources already exclude closed/merged PRs. Once the winner closes (e.g. red CI), it leaves the open
 * set and the next-earliest OPEN claimant becomes the winner on re-eval — no permanently-orphaned cluster.
 *
 * SECOND CONSUMER (#2278): this module is intentionally engine-hosted (not `src/`-only) because its election
 * logic is reusable for the miner's own soft-claim adjudication — deciding which of several miners claiming
 * the same issue proceeds. A future contributor wiring the miner's local claim ledger should import this
 * module rather than reimplementing the election rule, so both the maintainer gate and the miner agree on
 * exactly one winner by construction.
