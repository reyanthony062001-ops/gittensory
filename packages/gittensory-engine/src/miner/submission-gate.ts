// Gated-submission trigger (#2336): THE safety-critical chokepoint of Phase 4 -- the actual decision point
// that decides "call gittensory_open_pr NOW" for an autonomous run. Conservatively requires BOTH a predicted-
// gate PASS AND a slop score under a configurable threshold before a local-write open_pr action spec is ever
// built. Any ambiguity (a missing/errored signal) resolves to NOT submitting -- this function never defaults
// to allow.
//
// SEQUENCING: runs BEFORE `buildOpenPrSpec` (src/mcp/local-write-tools.ts) is ever called -- i.e. before the
// Governor chokepoint (#2340) ever sees an open_pr action spec to evaluate. The two are complementary, not
// redundant: this gates on CONTENT-QUALITY signals (predicted-gate conclusion, slop risk) specific to the
// candidate diff; the chokepoint gates on RESOURCE/GOVERNANCE signals (rate-limit, budget, reputation, self-
// plagiarism, dry-run mode) that apply to every write action class, not just open_pr. "The actual call site
// invoking buildOpenPrSpec / gittensory_open_pr is gated exclusively through this function" (this issue's own
// deliverable) is a POLICY this and every future call site must honor -- wiring a real call site is a later,
// separate issue (mirrors #2333/#2335's own split between loop mechanics and policy).
//
// INPUT SHAPE: `predictedGateVerdict`/`slopAssessment` are typed exactly as the fields `SelfReviewVerdict`
// (self-review-adapter.ts, #2334) already carries, so a caller can pass the SAME verdict the iterate-loop's
// own self-review (#2333) already computed at handoff time -- this is a defense-in-depth RE-CHECK of that
// verdict immediately before submission, not a redundant re-computation from scratch.
//
// DRY-RUN: mirrors `src/settings/autonomy.ts`'s deny-by-default dial (`AUTONOMY_LEVELS`, `"observe"` as the
// floor) for safe rollout of THIS function's own thresholds -- distinct from, and evaluated separately from,
// the Governor chokepoint's own dry-run/live action-mode dial (#2342), which gates autonomous WRITING at all
// for a repo. `"observe"` here is specifically for safely calibrating the predicted-gate/slop thresholds
// against live traffic before ever trusting them to gate a real submission.
