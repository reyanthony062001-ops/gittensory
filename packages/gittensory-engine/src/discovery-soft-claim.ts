// Soft-claim coordination request builder (#4302). The local soft-claim ledger (claim-ledger.js) is 100%
// client-side — "never uploads, syncs, or phones home" — and duplicate-cluster adjudication
// (isDuplicateClusterWinnerByClaim, #3355) only resolves collisions AFTER the fact, by observing which PR/comment
// publicly landed first. This module closes that gap on the client side: a pure function that turns a local claim
// record into the request payload a miner would send to the optional hosted discovery-index (the contract in
// discovery-index-contract.ts, #4300) to softly announce/reserve an issue across the fleet BEFORE starting, so
// collisions are reduced rather than only detected afterward.
//
// Scoped as a "request builder", not a network client: pure input→output, no HTTP (wiring the hosted plane's
// client into the miner runtime is downstream of #4250 existing). It shares the discovery-index contract's posture:
// metadata-only and public-safe by construction — the request is built by explicitly copying a fixed set of
// known fields, never by spreading the input, so no unexpected/forbidden field can ride along.
//
// DECISION (the issue's open question — reject vs. release for non-active claims): a `released`/`expired` claim
// produces an explicit `release` request variant rather than being rejected, so the fleet learns an issue is free
// again; only an `active` claim produces a `claim` request.
