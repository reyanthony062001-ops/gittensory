// Per-repo activation resolver for the converged review features (phase 2 of the per-repo migration).
//
// Before: each feature ran when `isXEnabled(env)` (a global env flag) AND `isConvergenceRepoAllowed(env, repo)`
// (the GITTENSORY_REVIEW_REPOS allowlist) were both true — coarse, all-or-nothing per repo, and configured only
// via env. Now a self-host operator toggles features individually PER REPO in the container-private `.gittensory.yml`
// (`features:` block). The precedence, highest to lowest:
//   1. GLOBAL env flag (GITTENSORY_REVIEW_*) — a MASTER KILL-SWITCH. Off ⇒ the feature never runs anywhere,
//      regardless of any per-repo override (so an operator keeps one deploy-wide off switch per feature).
//   2. Per-repo `features:` override — `true`/`false` forces the feature on/off for this repo. EXCEPTIONS:
//      `safety` (prompt-injection defanging) is security-critical and `.gittensory.yml` lives in the repo
//      itself, writable by a lower-trust actor than the operator — so a repo override may only TIGHTEN
//      (force-on) the operator's global enablement, never loosen it. `features.safety: false` is treated as
//      "no opinion" (falls through to the allowlist default below) rather than an active force-off (#2269).
//      `grounding` can fetch full post-change file contents for the AI prompt, so the operator allowlist remains
//      mandatory; a repo override may only disable grounding inside that allowlist.
//   3. `GITTENSORY_REVIEW_REPOS` allowlist — the back-compat DEFAULT when the manifest says nothing, so a repo
//      that sets no `features:` block behaves exactly as it did before this change.
//
// `resolveConvergedFeature` is the pure core (takes the already-loaded manifest). `convergedFeatureActive` is the
// async convenience that loads the cached focus manifest itself — used at call sites that don't already hold one.
