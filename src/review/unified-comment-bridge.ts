// Unified-comment bridge (reviewbot→gittensory convergence, Stage D).
//
// A PURE, testable mapping from gittensory's live PR-review data (the gate `GateCheckEvaluation`, the AI
// `advisoryNotes` + consensus defect, the readiness signal rows + total, the footer) onto the ported
// unified renderer (`renderUnifiedReviewComment`). Flag-gated and default-OFF in the processor; flag-OFF
// keeps the legacy `buildPublicPrIntelligenceComment` path byte-identical.
//
// gittensory's GATE stays authoritative: we pass the gate-derived `decision` into `buildUnifiedReviewInput`
// so `deriveUnifiedStatus` lets it override the reviewer recommendations (the renderer already enforces
// this). The output PREPENDS the exact panel marker the legacy body carries, so the existing in-place
// upsert (`createOrUpdatePrIntelligenceComment`) updates the same comment instead of posting a duplicate.
//
// Public-safe: most inputs are already safe by construction — the AI notes via
// `composeAdvisoryNotes`→`toPublicSafe`; the consensus-defect blocker via `toPublicSafe` (in
// `consensusDefectOf`); the signal rows via the panel helpers' `sanitizePanelText`. The ONE input not
// covered by an existing filter is the gate's `warnings` (rendered as Nits) — those carry an
// AdvisoryFinding's raw title/action, which the check-run path sanitizes (`sanitizeForCheckRun`) but this
// comment path historically did not. This module therefore scrubs Nits itself (see `publicSafeNit` /
// `PRIVATE_FORBIDDEN_TERMS`) as defense-in-depth before they reach a public comment.

// ── Public-safe defense-in-depth (privacy-critical) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every field this bridge feeds into the renderer is ALREADY public-safe by construction on the live
// gittensory inputs (verified at convergence issue #1):
//   • panel rows (result/evidence) — built by buildPublicPrPanelSignalRows' panel helpers (public-safe);
//   • aiReview.notes — composed via composeAdvisoryNotes → toPublicSafe (drops anything unsafe);
//   • the consensus-defect title/detail — produced via toPublicSafe in consensusDefectOf.
// The ONE field whose inputs are NOT routed through an existing public-safe filter is the gate's
// `warnings` (turned into Nits): they carry an AdvisoryFinding's raw title/action. The gate/check-run
// path sanitizes those strings (sanitizeForCheckRun) before they reach GitHub, but this comment path
// did not. Rather than trust that every present and FUTURE warning finding is benign, scrub Nits with a
// boundary mirroring the check-run sanitizer + the legacy panel's private-term guard, and DROP a Nit
// that still trips the guard. This never alters flag-OFF (the legacy panel keeps its own filtering).
//
// Mirrors src/rules/advisory.ts CHECK_RUN_FORBIDDEN_TERMS (scrubbed → "[context]") and
