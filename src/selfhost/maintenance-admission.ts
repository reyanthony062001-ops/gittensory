// Maintenance-job backpressure / admission policy (#selfhost-runtime-pressure). User-facing work --
// github-webhook, agent-regate-pr, the regate sweep trigger, recapture-preview (everything at or above
// FOREGROUND_QUEUE_PRIORITY_FLOOR, see queue-common.ts) -- must always win a resource race against periodic
// maintenance sweeps (contributor evidence, burden forecasts, RAG re-indexing, drift scans, product rollups,
// notifications...). Those sweeps already run on a conservative cadence (every 30min/hourly/6-hourly, see
// index.ts's enqueueScheduledJobs); the subset that makes real GitHub REST calls ALSO yields to an EXHAUSTED
// GitHub REST budget (shouldWaitForGitHubRateLimit) via isGitHubBudgetBackgroundJob / GITHUB_BUDGET_BACKGROUND_TYPES
// (queue-common.ts) -- purely-internal sweeps that touch no GitHub API (product-usage rollups, retention
// pruning, notification delivery, and similar) have no such budget to yield to and correctly aren't in that set.
// This module adds an ORTHOGONAL signal on top of whichever of those a job type already has: is the box itself
// under load RIGHT NOW (a live-work backlog, an aging live job, a hot host CPU), independent of whether GitHub's
// API happens to be rate-limited. The queue backends (sqlite-queue.ts / pg-queue.ts) consult this at CLAIM time,
// the same way they already consult GitHub rate-limit admission where applicable: a denied maintenance job is
// pushed back to 'pending' with a jittered future run_after -- its original enqueue time is left untouched, so
// the age-based trickle below still works -- never dropped and never run early.
//
// TRICKLE: a maintenance job that has been pending since `maxDeferAgeMs` is force-admitted regardless of
// current pressure, so a box under SUSTAINED load can never starve maintenance work forever -- it just runs at
// a bounded minimum rate instead of its normal cadence.
//
// DRAIN (#selfhost-maintenance-self-pin): `maintenance_pending_high` alone is a LANE-WIDE aggregate count, with
// no feedback loop back to that count as individual jobs age out via the trickle above -- so once the lane backs
// up past `maxMaintenancePendingCount` and stays there (new maintenance work keeps arriving as fast as, or faster
// than, the trickle drains it), EVERY claim is denied `maintenance_pending_high` until each job independently
// reaches the full `maxDeferAgeMs` (hours later), and the aggregate count never has a chance to fall back under
// the threshold in the meantime -- the backlog is deferred because it's high, and stays high because it's
// deferred. `maintenanceDrainAgeMs` is a second, much shorter age escape scoped ONLY to the
// `maintenance_pending_high` branch: a job that has waited at least this long is admitted despite the lane still
// being over threshold, so the oldest jobs steadily leak through (throttled further by the queue's own
// `backgroundConcurrency` claim cap) and the aggregate count can actually shrink well before the 4h backstop.
// Newly-arrived jobs in the same burst still wait out `maintenanceDrainAgeMs` first, so this is a bounded trickle,
// not a flood -- and it applies to `maintenance_pending_high` alone: `live_pending_high` / `live_job_age_high` /
// `host_load_high` keep blocking maintenance outright, so live-review priority and host-load safety are untouched.
