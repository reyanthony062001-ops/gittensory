// previously could not be cached/persisted (they degraded to on-demand re-render). This implements only the get/put
// surface those two paths use; every other R2Bucket method is unused on self-host. Node-only (fs import never
// reaches the Worker bundle — wired in server.ts behind REVIEW_AUDIT_DIR). MODULAR + off by default: unset
// REVIEW_AUDIT_DIR ⇒ no REVIEW_AUDIT binding ⇒ captures degrade to on-demand exactly as before.
