// Self-host blob store, S3-compatible-bucket-backed variant. A minimal R2Bucket-compatible store (same
// get/put/delete surface as ./blob-store.ts's filesystem-backed one) that talks to an operator's OWN
// S3-compatible bucket -- Cloudflare R2 (https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com, region "auto"), or any
// other S3-compatible provider -- via signed REST calls (AWS SigV4, aws4fetch).
//
// Why this exists: the filesystem-backed store (REVIEW_AUDIT_DIR) persists screenshots on the SAME host that
// runs the review container, so the images embedded in a public GitHub PR comment are only reachable through
// that host's own public origin (PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN) and the /gittensory/shot proxy route -- if an operator
// keeps their instance behind a private network (Tailscale, a firewall, no public DNS at all), those images
// are unreachable for anyone outside that network, GitHub's own servers included. Storing in a genuinely
// public bucket instead decouples "does my review pipeline run on my own infrastructure" from "are the
// resulting public-facing images reachable by anyone" -- this store still only does get/put/delete; making the
// resulting keys PUBLICLY SERVABLE (a public r2.dev URL, or a custom domain connected to the bucket) is the
// operator's own one-time bucket setup, and `resolveShotUrl` (capture.ts) is what points served links directly
// at REVIEW_AUDIT_S3_PUBLIC_URL instead of this instance's own /gittensory/shot proxy once it's configured.
//
// MODULAR + off by default: unset REVIEW_AUDIT_S3_BUCKET (+ _ENDPOINT/_ACCESS_KEY_ID/_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) ⇒ no
// REVIEW_AUDIT_S3 binding ⇒ server.ts falls back to REVIEW_AUDIT_DIR (or, if that's unset too, on-demand
// rendering) exactly as before -- see server.ts's REVIEW_AUDIT wiring.
