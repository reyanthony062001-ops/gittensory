// Linked-issue satisfaction assessment (#2172, pure analysis core of #1961).
//
// We already enforce deterministic linked-issue HARD rules (src/review/linked-issue-hard-rules.ts) and fetch
// linked-issue text in grounding, but never judge whether the PR's diff actually satisfies what the issue
// asked for. This module is the bounded, AI-BACKED analysis core: prompt composition + response parsing only —
// NO gate wiring, NO disposition change, NO I/O (no env, no model call). The caller supplies the model's raw
// text output (from whichever provider it already resolved — self-host router or BYOK, exactly like
// ai-review.ts/ai-slop.ts do); this module never talks to a model itself. That orchestration (budget, provider
// selection, usage accounting, and — eventually — a `gate.linkedIssueSatisfaction` mode wiring) is a separate,
// maintainer-only slice.
//
// Hard guarantees (mirrors ai-slop.ts's fail-safe discipline):
//   • No issue text (empty/absent) ⇒ no finding. Never guesses "unaddressed" from silence.
//   • Malformed/unparseable model output, or a thrown error while composing ⇒ no finding, never throws.
//   • A LOW-CONFIDENCE "unaddressed" verdict is never published as unaddressed — it degrades to no finding,
//     so an uncertain model never manufactures a false "you didn't fix this" call that could spook a
//     contributor. "addressed"/"partial" are not similarly gated: a false-positive "looks addressed" is a much
//     lower-stakes error than a false "unaddressed" (advisory-only either way; no gate can read this yet).
//   • Every public string is forced through the public-safe filter; anything tripping the boundary is dropped.
