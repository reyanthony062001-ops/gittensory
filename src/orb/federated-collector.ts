// LoopOver federated fleet intelligence (#1970) — OPT-IN collector TRANSPORT client (#6479).
//
// Moves the anonymized bundles built by ./federated-bundle.ts (#6478) between self-hosted instances. Two
// directions, both best-effort and both off by default:
//   push — POST this instance's own bundle to the operator's configured collector.
//   pull — GET peer bundles from it.
//
// SCOPE — deliberately NOT the import side. A pulled bundle is fetched, shape-checked and RETURNED; it is
// never signature-verified, never trust-gated, and never persisted. That is #6480's job, and #6480 is blocked
// on #6477 (the key-trust/anti-poisoning design). Verifying here would not merely be out of scope, it would be
// WRONG: there is no trust anchor to verify against yet, and inventing one is exactly what #6477 exists to
// prevent (see the TODO(#6477) note on signFederatedBundle in ./federated-bundle.ts).
//
// NO DEFAULT COLLECTOR, BY DESIGN. The client only ever talks to an endpoint the operator configured in
// `.loopover.yml`. There is no hardcoded fallback and no auto-discovery — this codebase's self-host posture
// assumes no central/managed collector exists. (Contrast the #1255 orb path, which does POST to a hosted
// default at src/selfhost/orb-collector.ts:168; that is a different feature with a different contract.)
//
// FAIL-SAFE, ALWAYS. Every entry point resolves the opt-in BEFORE touching the database or the network, wraps
// its whole body in a catch, and degrades to a falsy result. Nothing here throws, so the review/gate path can
// never be slowed or broken by a collector that is unreachable, slow, rate-limited or returning garbage. The
// gate never awaits this; it is background, best-effort sync.
