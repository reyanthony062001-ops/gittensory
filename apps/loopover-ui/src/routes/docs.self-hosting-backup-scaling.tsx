      <h2>Default: SQLite single node</h2>
      <p>
        SQLite is the default because it is operationally simple and good enough for a single
        maintainer instance. The tradeoff is obvious: if the volume is lost, review state is lost.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="warn">
        Do not treat the default data volume as a backup. Snapshot it or enable continuous backup.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Continuous backup with Litestream</h2>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".env"
        code={`BACKUP_ACKNOWLEDGED=true
LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key>
LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>
LITESTREAM_ENDPOINT=s3.example.com
LITESTREAM_REGION=us-east-1`}
      />
      <CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`docker compose --profile litestream up -d`} />

      <h2>Scheduled backups</h2>
      <p>
        The bundled <code>backup</code> profile writes the active app database to the{" "}
        <code>loopover-backups</code> volume. SQLite installs use an online backup; Postgres
        installs use <code>pg_dump</code>. The same run also snapshots Qdrant when it is enabled.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`docker compose --profile backup up -d`} />

      <h3>Retention: how many backups are kept</h3>
      <p>
        Each run keeps the newest <code>BACKUP_RETAIN</code> backups (default <strong>7</strong>) —
        applied <em>independently per target</em>: <code>postgres/</code>, <code>sqlite/</code>, and{" "}
        <code>qdrant/</code> in the <code>loopover-backups</code> volume each retain their own
        newest 7, not 7 combined across all three. Set it in <code>.env</code> to change the window:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock filename=".env" code={`BACKUP_RETAIN=14`} />
      <p>
        <code>scripts/backup.sh</code>'s <code>normalize_backup_retain</code> guards against
        misconfiguration rather than failing the run: a non-numeric or empty value falls back to 7
        with a logged warning, and <code>BACKUP_RETAIN=0</code> is coerced up to 1 (a retention
        window of zero would delete the backup the script just took, so the script refuses that
        rather than leaving you with nothing).
      </p>
      <Callout variant="warn" title="A failed SQLite backup never prunes">
        If the SQLite online backup fails verification — the <code>.backup</code> command itself
        fails, the output file is empty, or its <code>PRAGMA integrity_check</code> doesn't come
        back <code>ok</code> — the script deletes the bad output, logs the failure, and — critically
        — <strong>skips the retention prune for the sqlite target on that run</strong>, so a broken
        backup can never push a known-good one out of the retained window. Postgres and Qdrant
        retention still run normally on that same pass, since only the SQLite leg failed. The run
        still exits non-zero so the failure is loud.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Multi-instance: Postgres and Redis</h2>

      <CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`docker compose --profile pgbouncer --profile qdrant up -d`} />
      <p>
        PgBouncer pools connections <em>between instances and Postgres</em>. Each app instance still
        opens its own connection pool to whatever it's pointed at (PgBouncer or Postgres directly),
        shared by every HTTP handler and queue worker in that instance — set <code>PGPOOL_MAX</code>{" "}
        (default 10) if a single instance needs more headroom than that under real concurrency (many
        registered repos, higher <code>QUEUE_CONCURRENCY</code>). Raise it gradually and watch for{" "}
        <code>LoopOverPostgresConnectionPressure</code>: that alert means you're approaching
        Postgres's own <code>max_connections</code>, a different ceiling than this per-instance pool
        size.
      </p>

      <h2>One-time SQLite to Postgres copy</h2>
      <p>
        Existing SQLite installs can copy state into a fresh Postgres database with the bundled
        migrator. It dry-runs by default and only commits when <code>--execute</code> is present.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`export DATABASE_URL=postgres://loopover:<password>@pgbouncer:5432/loopover
npm run selfhost:postgres:migrate -- --sqlite /data/loopover.sqlite
npm run selfhost:postgres:migrate -- --sqlite /data/loopover.sqlite --execute`}
      />

      <h2>Restore checks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Restore to a separate host or volume, never over the live instance first.</li>
        <li>
          Boot the app and confirm <code>/ready</code> returns 200.
        </li>
        <li>Confirm migrations do not fail or reapply incorrectly.</li>
        <li>Confirm recent review rows and job state are present.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Verify a backup is restorable</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>backup</code> profile ships <code>verify-backup.sh</code>, which checks the newest
        backup without touching the live database: Postgres <code>.dump</code> archives with{" "}
        <code>pg_restore --list</code>, and SQLite <code>.sqlite.gz</code> backups with a gzip and{" "}
        <code>integrity_check</code> pass. Run it against the newest backup, or a specific file:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`docker compose --profile backup run --rm backup sh /scripts/verify-backup.sh
docker compose --profile backup run --rm backup sh /scripts/verify-backup.sh /backups/postgres/loopover-<timestamp>.dump`}
      />
      <p>
        A healthy run ends with <code>[verify] postgres archive OK: … (N TOC entries)</code> (or{" "}
        <code>[verify] sqlite backup OK</code>), then <code>[verify] complete</code>, and exits 0.
        Corruption, a missing backup, or an empty archive exits non-zero with a{" "}
        <code>[verify]</code> reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove a dump actually restores, opt into a scratch restore into a <em>throwaway</em>{" "}
        database — never the live one:
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        lang="bash"
        code={`docker compose --profile backup run --rm \\
  -e VERIFY_RESTORE_SCRATCH=1 \\
  -e LOOPOVER_VERIFY_SCRATCH_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/loopover_verify \\
  backup sh /scripts/verify-backup.sh`}
      />
      <Callout variant="warn">
        The scratch restore runs <code>pg_restore --clean</code> against{" "}
        <code>LOOPOVER_VERIFY_SCRATCH_DATABASE_URL</code>, so point it at a dedicated database you
        can afford to drop. The script refuses to run when that URL equals the live backup source.
      </Callout>

      <h2>Restore drill: what "restore-tested" actually verifies</h2>
      <p>
        This exact flow has been run against a real production backup on a live instance: the dump
        was restored into a throwaway, network-isolated scratch database (a separate container,
        never the live one), which the script's own identity check confirmed was distinct from the
        backup source before touching anything. The restore completed cleanly and repopulated the
        application tables with representative production-scale data — not just an empty schema.
        Table and row counts will grow over time; treat restore-drill observations as point-in-time
        results, not invariants.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proves the backup content and the restore path both work end-to-end against real data.
        It deliberately stops short of booting a full app instance against the scratch database and
        polling <code>/ready</code>: that endpoint also gates on live Redis, Qdrant, the configured
        AI provider, Codex auth, and a real GitHub App key (see{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-operations">Operations</Link>'s health endpoints section) —
        reproducing all of those for a disposable scratch instance would mean copying real
        credentials into new, throwaway infrastructure, which is a bigger risk than the drill is
        worth. This drill proves the dump can be restored and its contents inspected at the database
        layer — it does not exercise the app's own <code>db</code> readiness probe, migration boot
        path, or <code>/ready</code> response. A full disaster-recovery rehearsal still needs to
        verify app readiness on the target infrastructure, using the operator's own real
        credentials.
