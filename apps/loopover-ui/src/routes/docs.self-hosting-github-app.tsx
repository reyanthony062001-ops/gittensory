        Direct App mode is the public default: it costs LoopOver nothing to support and can't
        overrun a shared rate-limit budget. Brokered mode routes every token mint through LoopOver's
        own infrastructure and GitHub API quota — every external brokered install is LoopOver's

      <h2>One-click App creation (recommended for a Direct App)</h2>
      <p>
        Before the App exists (no <code>GITHUB_APP_ID</code> set yet), the self-host serves a setup
        wizard at <code>GET /setup</code>. It renders a form that POSTs a GitHub App{" "}
        <em>manifest</em> — the exact permission and event set below, pre-filled — to GitHub's own
        App-creation flow. GitHub creates the App with the correct configuration in one step and
        redirects back to exchange credentials automatically; there is no manual permission
        checklist to get right or wrong. The route is disabled once an App is configured, so it
        can't rebind a live install.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock
        filename=".env"
        code={`PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN=https://reviews.example.com  # exact public URL, embedded in the manifest

      />
      <CodeBlock lang="bash" code={`open "https://reviews.example.com/setup"`} />
      <p>
        Enter <code>SELFHOST_SETUP_TOKEN</code> in the browser form. For scripted setup checks, send
        the token in an <code>x-setup-token</code> header or <code>Authorization: Bearer</code>
        header instead; never place the setup token in the URL.
      </p>
      <Callout variant="note">
        <code>https://reviews.example.com</code> above is a placeholder — it assumes you already
        have a real domain terminating TLS. GitHub delivers webhooks to whatever{" "}
        <code>PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN</code> you set here, so it must be an address GitHub's servers can
        actually reach: the <code>caddy</code> profile (see{" "}
        <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-security">Security</Link>'s TLS termination section) is the
        shipped way to get one, or bring your own public reverse proxy. The <code>tailscale</code>{" "}
        profile's private tailnet address does <strong>not</strong> work here — GitHub cannot
        deliver webhooks to it. A Tailscale-only instance should use brokered pull mode instead (it
        polls for work rather than receiving pushed webhooks) — see "Pull vs. push relay mode"

        Manual App creation (below) is still fully supported — for an air-gapped instance, a
        stricter change-review process, or simply a preference for reviewing every permission by
        hand before it exists. Whichever path you take, the resulting App needs the SAME
        permissions: this doc's manual list is kept in sync with the wizard's manifest and checked
        in CI, so the two can't silently drift apart.

        <li>Pull requests: write.</li>
        <li>
          Checks: write — the gate posts a check-run; <code>checks: read</code> alone 403s that
          write (silently fails the first review with no obvious cause).
        </li>
        <li>Issues: write.</li>
        <li>
          Contents: write — required for BOTH merging and the auto-maintain{" "}
          <code>update_branch</code> action. <code>contents: read</code> looks sufficient at
          creation time but silently breaks auto-merge later with no error surfaced in the UI; there
          is no lesser permission that keeps merge/update-branch working.

          Actions: write — lets a repo opt into cancelling a closed PR's in-flight CI runs (the{" "}
          <code>contributorCapCancelCi</code> setting). Off by default and never required: a repo
          that doesn't enable it, or an installation that hasn't re-approved this permission on an
          existing App, sees no behavior change — the cancellation attempt is skipped and logged,
          never blocking the close itself.

        Events: pull request, pull request review, push, issues, check suite, check run, and status.

      <h2>Re-approving a permission bump on an existing App</h2>
      <p>
        A future release can widen this permission list (most recently, Actions: write for the
        opt-in CI-cancellation feature). GitHub does <strong>not</strong> silently grant a new
        permission to an App that's already installed — the operator who owns the App must
        explicitly re-approve it, the same one-time consent step as the original install.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until you re-approve, the self-host keeps working exactly as before: any feature that needs
        the new permission degrades gracefully (skipped and logged, never a hard failure) rather
        than erroring. There's no forced upgrade window.
      </p>
      <p>To re-approve:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Open your App's settings page —{" "}
          <code>https://github.com/settings/apps/&lt;your-app-slug&gt;/permissions</code>{" "}
          (organization Apps:{" "}
          <code>
            https://github.com/organizations/&lt;org&gt;/settings/apps/&lt;your-app-slug&gt;/permissions
          </code>
          ).
        </li>
        <li>
          GitHub shows a diff between the App's currently-granted permissions and what the App
          manifest now requests. Review it, then save — GitHub sends the installation owner a
          request to accept the new grant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accept the request (as the installation owner, on each installed org/account). The new
          permission takes effect immediately; no App reinstall or webhook resubscription needed.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Before enabling this for anyone outside a controlled managed-beta cohort, weigh: (1){" "}
        <strong>rate-limit blast radius</strong> — every brokered install's GitHub API traffic draws
        from token pools LoopOver manages, so one misbehaving or high-volume install can degrade
        every other brokered install; (2) <strong>quota management</strong> — there is no automatic
        per-install cap on how much of that shared budget one enrollment can consume; (3){" "}
        <strong>support burden</strong> — a broken brokered install looks like a LoopOver outage to
        its operator, not a self-host misconfiguration, and lands as a support request on LoopOver
        directly; (4) <strong>abuse/misconfiguration risk</strong> — an enrollment secret that leaks
        or a misconfigured relay can mint tokens or receive webhook traffic for repos the intended
        operator doesn't control.

      <h2>Minimum broker safeguards before a public rollout</h2>
      <p>
        A maintainer go/no-go checklist — do not open brokered enrollment beyond a small, known,
        controlled cohort until every item below is true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Enrollment quota</strong> — a hard cap on how many brokered installs can be active
          at once, not just an informal agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Per-install concurrency limit</strong> — one brokered install cannot occupy an
          unbounded share of the token-minting or webhook-relay pipeline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Per-install rate budget</strong> — a ceiling on GitHub API calls attributable to a
          single enrollment, independent of the other installs sharing the broker.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Revocation path</strong> — an enrollment secret can be revoked immediately,
          without waiting for a deploy, when it's compromised or the install is abusive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Metrics broken out by enrollment</strong> — token-mint volume, webhook-relay
          volume, and error rate are visible per-enrollment, not only aggregated across every
          brokered install, so one bad actor is identifiable instead of hiding in the average.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        See <Link to="/docs/self-hosting-troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</Link> for what a degraded
        brokered relay looks like in logs today, and{" "}

      <h2>Connectivity checks</h2>
      <p>
        Confirm you can reach the instance at all before checking GitHub's own webhook delivery:

      <p>
        <code>reviews.example.com</code> here stands in for whatever you're checking from — the{" "}
        <code>caddy</code> profile's domain, an existing reverse proxy, or (if you're on the same
        tailnet) a Tailscale instance's tailnet address on port 8787. This only confirms{" "}
        <em>you</em> can reach the instance, not that <em>GitHub</em> can — a Tailscale-only
        instance in push mode will pass this check and still never receive a real webhook, since
        GitHub itself cannot reach a private tailnet address (see the callout above on{" "}
        <code>PUBLIC_API_ORIGIN</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        After installing the App on a test repo, open a small PR and confirm the webhook delivery
