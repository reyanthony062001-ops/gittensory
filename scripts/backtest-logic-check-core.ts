// classify function feeds each BacktestCase's captured raw context (#8129/#8130, plus #8139's captured model
// response) through a caller-supplied detection function — dynamically imported by the CLI from the PR's own
// head/base checkouts — and the two resulting scores are compared with @loopover/engine's Pareto-floor
// discipline. No IO here — the CLI (backtest-logic-check.ts) does the dynamic imports, corpus read, D1
// persist, and file writes — mirrors scripts/backtest-corpus-export-core.ts's identical pure-core / thin-IO
// split.
