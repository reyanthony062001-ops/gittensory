# Self-host backup verification: check the newest backup produced by backup.sh WITHOUT touching the live
# database. Postgres `.dump` archives are validated with `pg_restore --list` (a readable custom-format dump
# whose table of contents is non-empty); SQLite `.sqlite.gz` backups are gzip- and integrity-checked in a
# temp copy. An OPT-IN scratch restore (VERIFY_RESTORE_SCRATCH=1 + a dedicated scratch DB URL) additionally
# restores the Postgres dump into a throwaway database and runs a sanity query — it refuses to touch the live
# database. Run on demand (newest backup, or a specific file):

# Strips the password from a postgres(ql):// URI -- from EITHER the userinfo (user:password@host) or a
# `password=` libpq query-string parameter (postgresql://user@host/db?password=secret is equally valid
# and equally a leak if left in place) -- and hands back everything else untouched (host, port, dbname,
# and every other query parameter), instead of re-parsing those pieces ourselves -- the same approach
# backup.sh uses, see that file for the full rationale. Userinfo detection is restricted to the authority
# component (before the first '/', '?', or '#'), never the whole remaining string, so a literal '@'/':'
# inside a query-string value (e.g. ?application_name=a:b@worker) is never mistaken for credentials.
# Unlike backup.sh, this script may need to connect to TWO different URLs in the same run (the live source
# and a scratch database), so this takes the URL as an argument and is safe to call repeatedly: it always
# unsets PGPASSFILE first, so a previous call's password can never leak into a connection for a URL that
# doesn't have one of its own. Sets $PG_SANITIZED_URL; exports PGPASSFILE (tracked in $PG_PASSFILES for
# cleanup) if the given URL had a password.
#
# NOT extracted into selfhost-pg-url.sh alongside url_decode/pgpass_escape (#2910): despite sharing the
# same URI-parsing algorithm as backup.sh's prepare_pg_env(), the two are not safe to collapse into one
# function given the PGPASSFILE-lifecycle differences described above (arg vs. global URL, unset-at-start
# reentrancy guard, a tracked LIST of passfiles vs. one). See prepare_pg_env in backup.sh.

  # below (e.g. url_decode) would otherwise inherit a still-exported PGPASSFILE left over from a PREVIOUS

  # connection's actual identity instead of comparing the raw strings: `pg_control_system()`'s system_identifier
  # is a random 64-bit value fixed for the life of that specific cluster's data directory (independent of how
  # the connection was dialed — unlike a network-address fingerprint, e.g. inet_server_addr(), which can
  # legitimately differ for the SAME server across connections over different address families, such as an IPv4
  # vs IPv6 loopback — a false "these differ" that would defeat the guard). Combined with current_database(),
  # this correctly matches "same server AND same database" while still treating a different database name on
  # the same cluster as distinct (a legitimate, common scratch-DB setup). No special privilege is required:
  # PUBLIC has EXECUTE on pg_control_system() by default. Any failure to fingerprint EITHER side aborts (fail
  # closed) rather than assuming the databases differ.
  # Takes an ALREADY-sanitized URL, not the raw one -- pg_connect_arg must be called by the caller in the
