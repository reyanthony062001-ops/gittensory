# Ensure every Docker Compose secret file docker-compose.yml's `loopover` service references
# actually exists on disk, so `docker compose build`/`up` never fails on a missing `secrets:` source
# file -- Compose requires the file to exist even for an operator who has never touched this feature
# and is relying entirely on inline .env values (see secrets/README.md: an inline value always wins
# over the file, so a placeholder here is a pure no-op for that operator).
#
# MODE 644, NOT 600 (#secrets-uid-mismatch, a real incident on edge-nl-01 -- see docker-compose.yml's
# own secrets: comment for the full "why"): standalone Compose secrets are a plain bind mount, which
# cannot remap in-container ownership the way Swarm secrets can -- the container reads this file AS
# ITS OWN uid (the Dockerfile's `USER node`, 1000), essentially never the deploying host user's uid, so
# an owner-only 600 file is unreadable to the app and load-file-secrets.ts's readFileSync throws. 644
# is the minimum that works portably across arbitrary host/container uid pairs without requiring the
# operator's host to have a matching uid or group -- this trades host-local-user readability (a lower
# bar: requires an actual shell on this machine) for what the original hardening was actually about:
# no longer visible via `docker inspect`/`docker compose config`/full env-var dumps.
#
# IDEMPOTENT AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE: for a RANDOM_SECRET_FILE (below), generates a real `openssl rand -hex
# 32` value the first time the file is missing or still empty (#4928 -- this is what lets an operator
# boot without ever running that command by hand). For an EXTERNAL_SECRET_FILE (issued by GitHub /
# PagerDuty / Claude / the broker operator -- nothing this host can generate a USABLE value for), it
# still only creates an empty placeholder, unchanged from before. Either way, a file that already has
# real content is left completely alone: the instant a value is written into it (by an operator or by
# this script), its size is no longer zero, so nothing here regenerates or re-heals it again. Safe to
# run on every deploy, unconditionally.

# Usage:

# Self-generatable: no external party has to have already agreed on the value, so a random one is exactly
# as valid as an operator-typed one. github_webhook_secret is included here too -- an operator creating
# the GitHub App by hand (rather than through the /setup wizard's manifest flow, which gets this value
# for free from GitHub) picks this value themselves and pastes the SAME string into the App's webhook
# settings; generating it here just gives them something to copy instead of typing the command themselves.
