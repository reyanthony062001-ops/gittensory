// Regression coverage for the #4364 AI_ADVISORY per-capability routing at its real call sites (as opposed to
// advisory-ai-routing-config.test.ts, which only covers the pure yml normalizer, and selfhost-ai.test.ts,
// which only covers withAdvisoryAiEnv in isolation). Each test proves the FULL wire from
// settings.advisoryAiRouting through to which env.AI vs env.AI_ADVISORY binding actually gets called.
